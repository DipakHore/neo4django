Changes
-------

0.1.3 (2011-09-20)
------------------
- Refactored model access to be more like traditional Django. To define models, import `from neo4django.db import models`.
- Added a database router to allow mixing of neo4django/Django ORM in one project.

0.1.2 (2011-09-01)
------------------
- Model to model casting. (issue #7)

0.1.1 (2011-08-30)
------------------
- One-to-one relationship support. (issue #10)
- Fixed a major bug where `NodeQueryset`s weren't returning models without filtering. Improved the test to catch a regression.
